#Description:
'''Letâ€™s take a closer look at the code. After importing the image module, we create an image object called img that represents a typical digital photo. We will update each pixel in this image from top to bottom, left to right, which you should be able to observe. You can change the values in setDelay to make the program progress faster or slower.

Lines 8 and 9 create the nested iteration that we discussed earlier. This allows us to process each pixel in the image. Line 10 gets an individual pixel.

Lines 12-14 create the negative intensity values by extracting the original intensity from the pixel and subtracting it from 255. Once we have the newred, newgreen, and newblue values, we can create a new pixel (Line 15).

Finally, we need to replace the old pixel with the new pixel in our image. It is important to put the new pixel into the same location as the original pixel that it came from in the digital photo.

Try to change the program above so that the outer loop iterates over the columns and the inner loop iterates over the rows. We still create a negative image, but you can see that the pixels update in a very different order.'''
